Assignment 01 - Bag of Marbles
Author: Eduarda (Duda) Reolon

Goal: 
Design and code a program that shows the behavior of a bag that can store marbles. The implementation must include a way to add and to remove marbles from the bag. 

Implementation:
My vision to represent a bag of marbles is to have the bag be an array of the a struct type that I define. An array is a type of data structure that has the
capability to store several different elements, being that each element will be identified under a specific index. Struct is short for 'structure' and is a special
feature that allows programmers to create a costum data type. Structures are a way to store data that is different but somehow related under one big domain. On my
code, the marbles were stured under a struct called Marble. I did not explore in depth all the uses of a struct on my assignment solution as the marbles on my
program only differ in color. However, if I had made my program more sophisticated, I could have added that each marble had its own size, weight, and etc, and having
all marbles under one structure would have made it easier to store all the information about them. 

Now for the methods my program will include 3 of them:
  1. To add a marble to the bag:
  2. To remove a marble from the bag:
  3. To display the content that is inside of the bag:

Testing:
7 testings were run on the program, see the results below:
